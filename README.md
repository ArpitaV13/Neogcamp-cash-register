A cash register app which tells you how much change you will get in return. ðŸ”¢

# How it works :

* This takes your bill amount and the cash given as input. ðŸ’¯
* If the cash given is greater than the bill amount it tells us how much money we will get back. ðŸ•¥

Do share it with your friends too! ðŸ¤™
